> Why does the calendar display duplicate events? 

Events are often advertised on multiple listserves and these are treated as unique events. Additionally, events are often advertised multiple times on the same listserve. We try to remove duplicate events, but the script isn't perfect. Feel free to contribute [here](https://github.com/iamjli/MIT_talks).
